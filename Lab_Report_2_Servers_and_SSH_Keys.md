# **Part 3**
*Describe something you learned from lab in week 2 or 3 that you didn't know before.*

From the previous labs during week 2 and 3 I learned how to form a remote connection using virtual system of my user stunuguntla@ieng6.ucsd.edu. Using the connection I was able build and run a server from first using `git clone` command on the repository to be able to clone into my local system and setting the directory using `cd` command to wavelet. In week 3 Lab I was able to create a public key that allowed me to bypass without needing to enter a password by creating a unique key and during this time I also learned how new command `scp` and `mkdir` are used. I found out that `scp` command stands for secure copy and allows for securely copying file between servers. The `mkdir` command stands for make directory and is used for create new directories.
